              <p>Alfalfa is generally well-tolerated. However:</p>

                <li>Very high doses may cause digestive upset or sensitivity</li>
                <li>Alfalfa contains <strong>L-canavanine</strong>, which in rare cases can affect those with autoimmune conditions like lupus</li>
                <li>Avoid if you're on blood thinners (due to high Vitamin K content)</li>

              <p>Alfalfa is generally considered safe in food-like amounts during pregnancy, especially for its high calcium, iron, and chlorophyll.</p>
              <p className="mt-2">However, it should be avoided in <strong>very high doses</strong> due to its hormone-like activity.</p>
